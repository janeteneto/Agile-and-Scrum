### Gathering requirements effectively

- Effective requirements gathering ensures that everyone involved has a shared understanding of what needs to be built, which helps in avoiding misunderstandings and reducing the risk of developing the wrong product. It promotes transparency, collaboration, and early feedback, allowing for timely adjustments and improvements.
- Effective requirements gathering requires active participation from stakeholders, a shared understanding of Agile principles, and adherence to Scrum practices. It also requires the ability to elicit and capture requirements accurately and to adapt to changing circumstances.

### Wireframes and Storyboards

- Wireframes and storyboards are both visual tools used in the early stages of product development to communicate and visualise ideas.

- **Wireframes** are usually created using simple shapes, lines, and placeholders to depict the basic layout, structure, and functionality of a digital product. They serve as a blueprint or a skeleton that outlines the structure and flow of the user interface, allowing stakeholders and designers to discuss and validate the overall concept and functionality early in the design process.
- **Storyboards** are used to illustrate the flow and progression of a user's interaction with a product or system. They are typically composed of a series of sketches or frames, each depicting a specific step or action in a user's journey.

**User personas** - fictional representations of the target users of a product or service. They are created based on research and analysis of user demographics, behaviors, goals, and needs. User personas help teams understand and empathise with their users, enabling them to design and develop products that cater to specific user characteristics and preferences.

**Prioritised Backlog** - list of work items or tasks that need to be completed in a project or product development process. It represents a prioritised order in which these items should be addressed. The backlog is typically managed and ordered by the product owner or the team, with the most important and valuable items placed at the top.
- An **estimation technique** used to do this, can be the **Planning Poker** game, where team members assign relative effort estimates (usually in story points) to tasks or user stories. Through discussions and consensus-building, the team collectively determines the estimates.

**Sprint Retrospective** - recurring meeting in the Scrum framework where the Scrum team reflects on their work processes, collaboration, and outcomes from the previous sprint or iteration. It provides an opportunity for the team to inspect and adapt their practices, identify areas for improvement, and make adjustments to enhance their performance and productivity.

**Definition of Ready (DoR)** - defines the criteria that a user story or backlog item must meet before it can be considered ready for selection and inclusion in a sprint or iteration. It serves as a checklist or set of conditions that ensure the team has sufficient information and clarity to start working on the item. It usually includes:

1. Clear description and purpose of the user story.
2. Acceptance criteria defined.
3. Dependencies identified and resolved.
4. Proper estimates and sizing performed.
5. All necessary information and resources are available.

**Definition of Done (DoD)** - outlines the set of criteria or conditions that must be met for a user story, feature, or increment of work to be considered completed and ready for release. often includes elements such as:

1. Functional requirements implemented.
2. Code reviewed and tested.
3. User acceptance criteria met.
4. Documentation updated.
5. Performance and security standards fulfilled.

- **The key difference between DoR and DoD** lies in their focus and timing within the development process. DoR addresses the readiness of a user story before it enters the sprint backlog, ensuring that it is well-defined and actionable. DoD, on the other hand, defines the completion criteria for an item at the end of the development process, ensuring that it meets the necessary quality standards and is ready for release.

**User Stories and Epic Stories**

- *User stories* are concise, user-centric descriptions of a specific piece of functionality or a feature of the product. They are typically written from the perspective of the end user and follow a simple template: "As a [user role], I want [feature] so that [benefit or value]." User stories focus on capturing the user's need, motivation, and the value they expect to derive from the feature.
- *Epic stories* are larger, higher-level user stories that represent a significant piece of work or a large feature that cannot be completed within a single sprint or iteration. Epics are usually too big and complex to be implemented as is, and therefore, they are broken down into smaller, more manageable user stories during backlog refinement or sprint planning sessions. Epics provide an initial understanding of the overall scope and vision of the feature or functionality, allowing for further decomposition into user stories that can be prioritized and worked on in sprints.
